# D&D Character Simulator

Welcome to the **D&D Character Simulator**! This project allows you to create and interact with a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) character sheet through code. You’ll be able to retrieve and manipulate character attributes like class, ancestry, and scores for various abilities (e.g., strength, intelligence). This simulator is an engaging way to learn Rust programming fundamentals while building a D&D character.

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main components:
- **dnd-character-simulator**: The main code where you interact with the D&D character API to retrieve and display character details.
- **dnd-character-api**: A black box API that provides simulated responses for D&D character attributes.

## Features

- **Character Information**: Retrieve the character’s name, class, and ancestry.
- **Attributes**: Query for key attributes like strength, dexterity, intelligence, and wisdom.
- **Attribute Modifiers**: Calculate attribute modifiers based on D&D rules.
- **Fun Interaction**: Experiment with random character generation and attribute scores.
